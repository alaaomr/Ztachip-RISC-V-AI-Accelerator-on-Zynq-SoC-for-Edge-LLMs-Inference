## Tutorial: DFT Basics

> **For non-DFT engineers**: This section provides essential background to follow the exercises.

### Why DFT?

Manufacturing defects can cause circuit failures. DFT adds structures that make chips testable:

- **Without DFT**: Only primary inputs/outputs accessible → low test coverage
- **With DFT**: Internal states controllable and observable → high test coverage

### Key DFT Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Scan chain** | Flip-flops connected in series for shift-based testing |
| **Scan mode** | Test mode where flip-flops act as a shift register |
| **ATPG** | Automatic Test Pattern Generation - creates test vectors |
| **Fault coverage** | Percentage of faults detected by test patterns |
| **Stuck-at fault** | Fault model where a signal is stuck at 0 or 1 |
| **BIST** | Built-In Self-Test - on-chip test generation/checking |
| **Controllability** | Ease of setting internal nodes to desired values |
| **Observability** | Ease of propagating internal values to outputs |

### Scan Chain Basics

```
Normal Mode:    D → [FF] → Q    (functional operation)

Scan Mode:      SI → [FF] → SO   (shift operation)
                     ↑
                    SE (scan enable)
```

A scan flip-flop has:
- **SI** (Scan In): Serial input for test data
- **SE** (Scan Enable): Switches between normal and scan mode
- **SO** (Scan Out): Usually connected to Q, chains to next FF's SI

## Exercise 1: Scan Architecture Design (10 min)

### Objective
Use Claude to design a scan chain architecture for a given design.

### Step 1: Analyze Design for Scan

Provide Claude with a design description:

```
I have a digital design with these characteristics:

- 5,000 flip-flops total
- 4 clock domains: clk_core (500MHz), clk_io (100MHz), clk_mem (200MHz), clk_test (50MHz)
- Maximum scan chain length allowed: 200 FFs
- Scan shift frequency: 50 MHz
- Constraints:
  - Keep clock domains separate in scan chains
  - Memory interface FFs should be in dedicated chains

Design a scan architecture that:
1. Determines the number of scan chains needed
2. Assigns FFs to chains by clock domain
3. Estimates total scan shift time
4. Identifies potential issues or recommendations

Save the analysis to scan_architecture.md
```

### Step 2: Generate Scan Insertion Script

```
Generate a TCL script for scan insertion (Synopsys DFT Compiler style) that:

1. Defines scan configuration
2. Sets up clock domains for scan
3. Specifies scan chain count and max length
4. Identifies scan enable and test mode signals
5. Runs DRC and reports results

Include comments explaining each section.
Save to scan_insert.tcl
```

### Step 3: Review and Iterate

```
Review the scan architecture for these concerns:
1. Are there any clock crossing issues during scan shift?
2. What's the total test time for a full scan?
3. Are there any FFs that should NOT be in scan chains?
4. Recommendations for reducing test time?
```

## Exercise 2: ATPG and Test Patterns (10 min)

### Objective
Use Claude to understand and analyze ATPG patterns.

> **Note**: Keep things interactive! Ask Claude to explain pattern generation concepts, analyze coverage reports, or suggest improvements.

### Step 1: Understand ATPG Concepts

```
Explain how ATPG works for stuck-at faults:

1. How does a pattern detect a stuck-at-0 fault?
2. What is fault activation and propagation?
3. What makes a fault "undetectable"?
4. Explain ATPG controllability and observability

Use a simple example circuit (AND gate, OR gate, FF) to illustrate.
```

### Step 2: Create a Coverage Report Parser

We've provided a sample coverage report. Rather than asking Claude to analyze reports directly, let's create a reusable tool:

```
Write a Python script that parses ATPG coverage reports like sample_atpg_report.txt:

1. Extract coverage percentages by fault type (stuck-at, transition, etc.)
2. List modules with coverage below a configurable threshold
3. Categorize untestable faults by reason (tied, blocked, redundant)
4. Generate a summary with:
   - Overall coverage vs. target
   - Top modules needing attention
   - Actionable recommendations

Include command-line arguments for:
- Input report file
- Target coverage threshold (default 95%)
- Output format (text, json)

Save to parse_atpg_report.py
```

> **Why a script?** Reports change frequently during a project. A parser script gives you consistent, repeatable analysis and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

### Step 3: Extend the Analysis Script

```
Extend parse_atpg_report.py to also:

1. Compare coverage against a baseline file (previous run)
2. Highlight regressions (coverage decreases)
3. Track coverage trends if given multiple report files
4. Generate alerts for modules that dropped below threshold

Add command-line options:
- --baseline: previous report for comparison
- --trend: directory of historical reports

Update parse_atpg_report.py
```

## Exercise 3: BIST Implementation (10 min)

### Objective
Use Claude to generate BIST (Built-In Self-Test) components.

### Step 1: Generate an LFSR

```
Generate a Verilog module for a 16-bit LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register)
for use in BIST:

Requirements:
- Parameterizable width
- Maximum-length sequence polynomial
- Seed loading capability
- Enable signal for controlled stepping

Include comments explaining:
- The polynomial used and why
- How to calculate the sequence length
- Typical BIST applications

Save to lfsr.v
```

### Step 2: Generate a MISR

```
Generate a Verilog module for a Multiple-Input Signature Register (MISR):

Requirements:
- Parameterizable width (default 32 bits)
- Compresses multiple inputs into a single signature
- Signature comparison output
- Expected signature register

Explain how MISR compaction works and potential aliasing issues.

Save to misr.v
```

### Step 3: Create a Simple BIST Controller

```
Create a simple BIST controller that:

1. Generates patterns using the LFSR
2. Applies patterns to a device under test (DUT)
3. Compresses responses with MISR
4. Compares final signature to expected value
5. Reports pass/fail status

Interface:
- clk, rst_n
- bist_start (input) - starts BIST sequence
- bist_done (output) - BIST complete
- bist_pass (output) - test passed

Parameters:
- PATTERN_COUNT - number of patterns to apply

Save to bist_controller.v
```

### Step 4: Simulate BIST

```
Create a testbench that:
1. Instantiates the BIST controller with a simple DUT (use an ALU or counter)
2. Runs the BIST sequence
3. Verifies pass/fail output
4. Displays pattern count and signature

Save to bist_tb.v and run the simulation.
```

## Quick Reference: DFT Concepts

### Scan Flip-Flop Structure

```verilog
// Scan FF behavior
always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n)
        q <= 1'b0;
    else if (scan_enable)
        q <= scan_in;    // Scan mode: shift
    else
        q <= d;          // Normal mode: capture
end
assign scan_out = q;
```

### Common LFSR Polynomials

| Width | Polynomial | Max Length |
|-------|------------|------------|
| 8-bit | x⁸ + x⁶ + x⁵ + x⁴ + 1 | 255 |
| 16-bit | x¹⁶ + x¹⁵ + x¹³ + x⁴ + 1 | 65,535 |
| 32-bit | x³² + x²² + x² + x¹ + 1 | 4,294,967,295 |

### DFT Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Stuck-at coverage | % of stuck-at faults detected | > 95% |
| Transition coverage | % of transition faults detected | > 90% |
| Test pattern count | Number of patterns needed | Minimize |
| Scan chain balance | Variation in chain lengths | < 5% |
